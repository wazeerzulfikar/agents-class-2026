# Course Agent runtime

There is one logical agent definition: `course-agent`. Each run combines that definition with a trusted `PrincipalContext`, portable conversation events, and already-authorized tool, resource, and skill metadata.

## Runtime boundary

`agent_core.AgentRuntime` remains the platform boundary. `runtime_smolagents.SmolagentsRuntime` is one adapter and is the only production package that constructs `smolagents.ToolCallingAgent`. It creates a fresh transient framework agent for a run, reconstructs recent conversation context from canonical events, and returns only `AgentResult` and `Event` contracts. Context selection keeps the 24 most recent user/agent messages and 16 useful tool-completion or workspace-interaction events. Run lifecycle and tool-request bookkeeping do not consume that budget.

The adapter reconstructs those portable user and assistant events as correctly role-scoped, ephemeral smolagents memory before each run. Dialogue is never flattened into the system instructions, and the transient memory is discarded afterward. This preserves conversational follow-ups—especially confirmations, corrections, requests to continue, and attachments—without making framework state canonical.

No smolagents agent, memory, model, `RunResult`, or pickle is canonical persistent state. `CodeAgent` is not used.

`agent_core.ModelProvider` is a small generic factory boundary. The v1 `OpenAIModelProvider` returns a transient smolagents `OpenAIModel`; another provider or runtime can replace it without migrating event history.

smolagents 1.x sends `ToolCallingAgent` function tools through Chat Completions. GPT-5.6 Terra requires `reasoning_effort="none"` for function tools on that endpoint, so the adapter sets it explicitly. A future Responses API model adapter can restore reasoning effort without changing the `AgentRuntime` contract or persisted history.

The runtime supplies tool definitions only through the provider's structured function-tool
field. Its small application-owned Smolagents template does not render names, descriptions,
schemas, or notional tool examples into the textual system prompt. The permanent prompt is
limited to identity, provenance, trust boundaries, conversational continuity, authorized
resource and skill metadata, a role-filtered notification-center attention snapshot, and non-empty
workspace state needed for follow-up actions.

For authenticated runs, the identity section contains only the trusted display name (falling back
to username) and active course role, such as `student`, `ta`, `instructor`, or `admin`. It excludes
user IDs, session IDs, email addresses, and credentials. Anonymous runs receive no identity section.

For authenticated runs, `CourseAgentService` asks the notification-center projection for unread
course updates and replies, assignment deadlines within fourteen days, and instructor/TA questions
that still need a response. This data is placed in `AgentContext.metadata`; it does not change the
stable `AgentContext` contract. The runtime asks the Course Agent to mention material items
concisely, avoid repeating an item already discussed in recent dialogue, suggest a next action, and
use authorized tools before adding details not present in the trusted snapshot. Anonymous runs
receive no user-specific attention data.

An authenticated page load uses `CourseAgentService.greet_on_page_load` in a fresh conversation.
The method appends an inspectable `agent.greeting.requested` platform event and gives the runtime a
neutral greeting task without appending a fake user message. All active projected items—including a
student's pending staff communication—are included as authorized attention. The greeting is capped
at approximately 70 words so it does not duplicate the notification center. When attention items
exist, it uses a compact Markdown list that separates what is new since the last visit from ongoing
communications, assignments, and other pending items. Its wording, prioritization, and any useful
suggested action are chosen by the Course Agent rather than assembled from an application-authored
response template. If the projection contains no `new_since_last_visit` category, the agent treats
all supplied items as previously seen and summarizes only outstanding obligations or conversations
with useful next actions; it does not re-announce them as updates. After a successful greeting, the server
acknowledges the one-time Updates projection for that user; Communications and Upcoming items remain
active according to their own lifecycle. The operation is idempotent per conversation. Anonymous
page loads keep the static public welcome and do not consume model quota.

## Configuration and secrets

The CLI loads `.env` without overriding existing process variables. `OPENAI_API_KEY` is the canonical model key name and follows official OpenAI environment-variable conventions. `BRAVE_API_KEY` authenticates public text search. The previous `MODEL_API_KEY` name remains accepted temporarily so existing Phase 2 development files continue working. Surrounding whitespace is removed; actual line breaks and literal `\\n`/`\\r` sequences are rejected. Secrets are never printed, logged, or written to events. CLI failures report only a sanitized exception-type chain plus strictly validated HTTP status, error type, code, and parameter fields. They never render provider exception messages, request bodies, headers, or tracebacks.

The initial defaults are:

```text
agent id: course-agent
runtime: smolagents-toolcalling
provider: openai
model: gpt-5.6-terra (overridable with MODEL_ID)
max steps: 10 (overridable with AGENT_MAX_STEPS)
skills path: ./skills (overridable with SKILLS_PATH)
```

## Tool and resource boundary

Phase 6 exposes these public tools:

```text
course.read_syllabus
course.read_public_file
course.get_schedule
course.get_application
course.show_public_files
course.search_faq
course.list_faq_updates
course.read_faq_update
course.search
course.list_my_communications (exact student role only)
course.read_my_communication (exact student role only)
course.submit_application
course.ask_ta (configured, exact student role only)
course.list_assignments (logged-in student, TA, or instructor)
course.get_assignment (logged-in student, TA, or instructor)
instructor.message_students (exact instructor role only)
instructor.list_students (exact instructor role only)
course.list_student_projects (configured, authenticated course members only)
course.inspect_student_site (configured, authenticated course members only)
staff.inspect_student_repository (configured, TA/instructor/admin only)
web.search
web.search_images
web.visit
skills.read
skills.read_reference
```

The readable resources are `course://syllabus`, `course://schedule`,
`course://repositories`, `course://faq`, `course://instructors`, and
`course://application`. Application wrappers use canonical IDs, resource URIs, and JSON
input schemas that translate directly to MCP. They are not a second wire protocol, and
an MCP server is intentionally deferred.

Authorization happens before smolagents receives tools. `CourseCapabilityPolicy` grants
public resources to everyone, student resources to students and instructors, and instructor
resources only to instructors, and application-review tools to instructors and students
(students are restricted to explicitly shared application UUIDs); `ToolCatalog` fails closed if
trusted context names an unregistered tool. Read and search tools independently constrain
work to authorized resource URIs during execution. Model-controlled input cannot select a
filesystem path or applicant directory. The schedule tool identifies its source as
provisional.

`course.list_faq_updates` lists recent staff-approved Q&A without requiring a topical search term;
`course.read_faq_update` reads the complete selected public entry. `course.search_faq` remains the
topic-specific path. This distinction lets a request for “Q&A additions” inspect recent publication
history instead of guessing a search query.

`course.list_my_communications` and `course.read_my_communication` provide on-demand access to the
active student's private question threads and confirmed instructor messages, including a question
submitted anonymously to staff. Both tools derive student ownership from `PrincipalContext`,
recheck the active account in application code, and retain only a generic tool summary in canonical
history. They cannot enumerate or read another student's records. Public, staff-approved Q&A stays
separate and is retrieved with the FAQ list/read/search tools; a `PRIVATE` answer never enters that
resource.

A successful trusted tool may issue resource URIs for a later tool call in the same runtime
invocation. The smolagents adapter adds only those tool-returned URIs to a transient grant set
bound to that run's existing principal and conversation. The set is discarded after the run;
model-provided URIs are never added, and a later run reconstructs authorization from trusted
platform state again.

Production capability policy also grants `workspace.review_presentation`. The runtime requires a
successful call immediately before accepting `final_answer`: the agent chooses whether to keep the
prior panel, use a panel prepared in the current turn, or answer without a visual. The platform
validates that bounded choice against trusted workspace events and in-run state, invalidates it on
every subsequent tool call, and suppresses streamed text from a rejected premature final answer.
One action step is reserved beyond `AGENT_MAX_STEPS` for the expected checkpoint. Isolated runtime
tests or adapters that do not authorize the checkpoint retain their previous behavior.

Assignment tools use a separate validated `AssignmentStore` boundary. Students and TAs can list
and read only published assignments whose release time has passed. Instructors can additionally
see drafts and scheduled records and receive create and update tools. Creation is form-backed: the
instructor-only skill opens the canonical assignment `draft-document`, user edits become validated
workspace events, and the create tool derives its complete Markdown input from trusted current
workspace state after the instructor selects Save. It generates the internal assignment ID, writes
one new server-chosen path, and refuses replacement. Update requires the complete proposed Markdown
document plus the revision the instructor reviewed, increments that revision, and atomically
replaces only the matching file. An authorized read emits a validated workspace panel containing
the exact stored Markdown. See
[ASSIGNMENTS.md](ASSIGNMENTS.md).

`instructor.list_students` exposes a paginated active-student directory (display name, username,
and email) only when the instructor messaging service is configured. Capability filtering and a
fresh stored-account role check both require the exact instructor role. It omits inactive students,
credentials, user IDs, and question ownership. Tool events retain only a count summary.

`instructor.message_students` is available only when the PostgreSQL-backed messaging service is
configured and the trusted principal has the exact instructor role. It resolves model-provided
recipient labels only against active student accounts, or snapshots all current active students,
then creates a private pending record. A pending-question notification may instead supply an opaque
reply reference; platform code verifies that the referenced question is still open and resolves its
stored student owner without asking the model to infer an identity. The tool cannot deliver the
message. A separate owned HTTP
confirmation may edit the subject and body while it atomically transitions that fixed snapshot to
sent, or may cancel without changing content; sent records are projected into
only their recipients' notification centers and attention context. Ordinary message confirmations
may also opt into email when `MAIL_ENABLED` is true. The fixed recipients and confirmed email flag
form a durable outbox consumed by the separate mail worker; the API never sends provider mail.
The confirmation tool arguments
are redacted from generic tool events, while the exact private preview remains in the instructor's
owned conversation event. Anonymous question references retain an anonymous recipient label in that
preview even though the platform keeps the actual account as the delivery target.
For pending-question replies, the editable body carries the existing email workflow's `PRIVATE` or
`PUBLISH` command. Confirmation records a real `TAAnswer`, closes the pending question, and reuses
the answer-event and FAQ-publication outboxes; it does not create a second student communication.
The mail worker mirrors an online resolution into the original staff email thread when that thread
exists.

The optional GitHub student-project tools use the same pre-model and execution-time checks.
All authenticated course roles can list and inspect every deployed course website. Students never
receive repository source or development metadata; TAs, instructors, and admins can make bounded,
read-only calls across the configured course repository collection. GitHub results remain
ephemeral to the current turn and durable events keep only completion summaries; the token remains
inside the provider adapter. See
[STUDENT_PROJECTS.md](STUDENT_PROJECTS.md).

Skills use standard `SKILL.md` directories with optional Markdown files under
`references/`. The repository-owned `skills/registry.json` is a separate authorization
registry, not a replacement skill format. It assigns each bundle one deterministic audience:
public, authenticated, students, or instructors. `CourseAgentService` filters skill metadata
from the trusted principal before constructing `AgentContext`; unauthorized skill names and
descriptions never reach the model. `skills.read` and `skills.read_reference` re-check that
same principal during execution and confine reference reads to registered files within the
skill directory. Full skill and reference contents are returned only to the current model
run; durable events keep a generic completion summary.

The role-scoped `instructor.inspect_application_images` tool resolves one to four
server-issued application UUIDs inside the private applicant store and submits their validated
photo bytes to the configured multimodal model only for an explicit visual request. Provider
storage is disabled, tool arguments are redacted from events, and canonical history receives
only resource provenance and a generic completion summary. The adapter prohibits identity,
sensitive-trait, personality, emotion, and admission-suitability inference from appearance.
Each inspected photo also receives an opaque `applicant://{application_id}/photo` reference.
The workspace accepts only references issued by that tool in the current authorized instructor
or student turn, and
the web client resolves them through the authenticated, no-store application-photo endpoint.
This lets the agent build a real private gallery without inventing filenames or making the
applicant directory web-accessible.

`document.inspect_page` provides the same ephemeral multimodal boundary for the focused PDF page.
The platform, not the model, resolves the `course://` or principal-owned `upload://` URI from
trusted workspace state and rechecks the run's resource grant. It renders one page to a bounded PNG,
extracts that page's text, and sends the PNG to the configured multimodal model with provider
storage disabled. The image bytes and model-facing data URL never enter `ToolExecutionResult` or
canonical events; the current run receives the textual inspection and page metadata, while history
keeps only a generic summary and resource provenance. Tool arguments are redacted from audit events.
PDFium rendering is serialized inside the process because its rendering API is not thread-safe.

Resource reads also return safe registered-asset IDs when a manifest declares them.
The runtime tells the agent to prefer those official assets, attach them to a visual
composition through the source resource URI and exact asset ID, and skip redundant web
image search. Asset ownership is revalidated by the workspace tool and HTTP endpoint.

`web.search` uses Brave's authenticated Web Search API behind the application-owned,
smolagents-visible tool boundary. Requests are serialized at the configured provider rate,
retry only bounded transport, rate-limit, and service failures, and have a hard timeout.
Provider authentication, query, quota, and temporary failures retain distinct safe categories
instead of being reported as generic invalid requests. `web.visit` remains an application-owned
public-page reader. `web.search_images` wraps DuckDuckGo-first DDGS image
search, with another DDGS public-image backend as an availability fallback, and returns
normalized direct HTTPS image candidates for registered workspace components. Results
include provider pixel dimensions when available plus derived aspect, orientation,
resolution, split-layout safety, and layout guidance; unknown dimensions are explicit
rather than silently treated as banner-safe. Over-constrained queries with site or quoted
syntax receive one automatic plain-language retry inside the same tool call. A fresh DDGS
client is created per request, so concurrent conversations do not share search state. Page
reads reject non-HTTP, credential-bearing, local, and private-network
destinations. Web result bodies are returned to the current model turn but are not
copied into durable event history; only a generic completion summary is stored.

Each transient agent receives a title-and-description index of its authorized course
information. The index contains no backing paths or canonical resource identifiers;
full resource content is read through an authorized tool only when needed. The runtime
instructions require the model to resolve internal pointers before answering and forbid
mentioning capability names, resource identifiers, storage locations, or filenames
unless the user explicitly asks about implementation.

The same progressive-disclosure rule applies to skills. At startup the application validates
the registry and scans standard frontmatter. A run initially receives authorized skill IDs
and descriptions. The agent calls `skills.read` when one matches the task and calls
`skills.read_reference` only for a reference listed by the loaded skill. Course application,
workspace presentation, visual composition, web/image/browser research, student-resource,
and instructor-review procedures therefore do not occupy every turn's system prompt.

`course.search` uses deterministic paragraph-level lexical matching over the current
registered files, so edits are visible without a server restart. The companion
`course_server.index_resources` command maintains normalized PostgreSQL full-text data
for inspection and later MCP-backed search without requiring embeddings.

`course.submit_application` is public so prospective students do not need an account.
Its schema requires every structured application field and a principal-owned temporary
photo upload. Server-side validation rejects missing, placeholder, too-short, malformed,
expired, foreign, and non-image inputs. Safe validation failures give the model every
affected field and the precise failed rule, including permitted enum values, so it can
ask the applicant a corrective question; unexpected tool errors remain generic. A
successful call writes the structured record and copied photo through a private server-side
store and returns a receipt UUID. Submitted content is not
a public resource and is not included in the tool-completion result persisted by the
runtime.

Application intent has a dedicated standard Agent Skill. The header's Apply action opens the canonical
draft directly. For ordinary conversation, there is no phrase or keyword trigger in the API:
the agent recognizes application intent, reads `course.get_application` once, and opens the
canonical draft with the workspace tool during that first turn. The workspace boundary
supplies all canonical fields even when the model omits props. Older model-created
course-application drafts are recognized, migrated to the canonical fields, and marked as
application state before the next turn. The agent retains values from conversation history
and the trusted draft and interviews in displayed field order. Each
turn discusses exactly one unconfirmed field. Existing researched candidates are shown
for confirmation instead of prompting for the value again, and later missing fields are
not previewed as a checklist. Each user reply permits one atomic application-draft
update; a second update is rejected with an instruction to return one final question and
wait. Research updates preserve every supported public email, affiliation, webpage,
interest, knowledge area, and practical skill as a sourced candidate or inference, including
fields that occur later in the form. Non-final model chatter is never streamed, so a
confirmation request cannot appear while tools are still running. Closed application
choices are carried in the draft and rendered as selects. The runtime preserves JSON
Schema enums, patterns, formats, and length bounds when adapting tools for smolagents.
The picture prompt says it is for class use only and can be any JPG/JPEG, PNG, or WebP
image the applicant wants to represent them. After every field is individually confirmed,
the agent summarizes the completed form for explicit approval and only then calls
`course.submit_application`. It must not draft an application letter or invent criteria.
Submission arguments are redacted from tool-request audit events; the private
application store remains canonical.

Chat attachments are uploaded before a message is sent. The user message includes only
the temporary receipt metadata—not file bytes or a server path—so an authorized tool can
refer to the upload. Upload ownership is reconstructed from the trusted principal rather
than accepted as a tool argument. Owned document receipts become temporary `upload://`
resources: the upload reader extracts their text for reasoning and DocumentViewer fetches
the exact private artifact. The agent does not replace an available upload with a public
web copy.

smolagents requires Python-identifier tool names, so the adapter maps `course.read_syllabus` to `course_read_syllabus` only inside the transient runtime. Events and persistent state always retain the canonical dotted ID.

When a successful tool emits a trusted presentation event—opening or updating a workspace panel,
or requesting an external-effect confirmation—the adapter appends a transient presentation
instruction to that tool result. The final-answer prompt reinforces the same general contract: UI
is the primary carrier of its visible content, while chat supplies only complementary context, a
brief handoff, or the next question. Text-only tool results do not receive this additional
instruction. The same rule is part of the Course Agent's core runtime instructions, independently
of which optional skill is loaded. Final text remains the model's output and streams normally; the
runtime does not inspect, remove, or substitute response prose.

`course.ask_ta` is an external-effect workflow with deterministic separation between permission
and confirmation. The agent can prepare a question only when mail is configured and the trusted
principal is a student. The tool writes a pending record and opens the platform confirmation
surface; it cannot queue or send the email. Only the owned confirmation API can queue it, and only
that Send transition can atomically replace the reviewed question while preserving its hidden
subject and optional context.
Only the separate `course_server.mail_worker` talks to the configured Gmail or Microsoft Graph API.
After Send or Cancel, an allowlisted trusted action event—not client-authored prose—triggers a
single idempotent agent continuation. The completed action and exact question become the trusted
runtime context. The current input is only a neutral description of the completed action and makes
clear that the platform has just finished the Send or Cancel transition. For an online answer it
also states the successful pending-to-answered transition in positive terms. The model decides
whether and how to acknowledge it and may continue any other unfinished work
without a prewritten browser response, duplicated question text, or a fabricated `user.message`.
The staff-question tool is withheld only for that continuation turn to prevent recursive
confirmation loops. A private staff reply event is included among recent supporting events so the
agent can discuss the answer on the student's next turn. The authorized staff reply places the
bounded `PUBLISH` or `PRIVATE` decision on a standalone line immediately before or after the answer.
After notifying the student, `PUBLISH` advances a durable publication outbox into `faq_entries`;
`PRIVATE` creates no shared knowledge. The coordinated publisher adds approved public fields to
the local FAQ JSON; `course://faq` reads and lexical search use that file without restarting the
runtime. The course-help skill directs the agent to check these later staff-approved clarifications
before relying on broader static course materials. If the answer remains undocumented and the
current student has the staff-question capability, the same skill directs the agent to offer that
capability rather than merely telling the student to contact staff independently.

## CLI-first flow

`course_server.agent_cli` creates a temporary anonymous session, creates its owned conversation, runs one turn, and persists canonical events to PostgreSQL. Its orchestration accepts injected stores and runtime so automated tests use a scripted model and make no external API calls.

## Stable interfaces

The Phase 3 additions to the stable application boundary are `Conversation` and `ModelProvider`. The executable tool/resource conveniences are intentionally internal until the MCP gateway phase establishes the external executable protocol.

## Deviations

There are no architecture deviations. `Conversation` was added to schema v1 additively because it was already named as an `agent_core` type in the constitution and no existing v1 document changed. MCP server transport remains deferred to its specified phase. Skill loading uses the constitution's standard directory shape and existing `AgentContext` fields and metadata, so it adds no wire-contract version or persistence migration. Phase 5 reports the concrete adapter's portable run/tool/resource events live through an optional application observer without changing `AgentRuntime`. The same adapter can optionally run smolagents in streaming mode and expose decoded final-answer text through one application callback. Private reasoning, non-final model content, full skill contents, and non-final tool arguments are discarded; non-streaming runtimes retain the ordinary `run` path, and no provider object becomes a core or persistence contract.

## Bounded runs and incomplete results

The adapter uses `BoundedToolCallingAgent` to distinguish normal final answers from stalled or
exhausted runs. Three consecutive tool batches with identical arguments and observations stop the
run; changing observations (for example, scrolling to new content) do not count as a stall. After
the second identical batch the model receives a recovery notice. Within the last three available
steps it receives a notice to checkpoint useful progress, review presentation, and finish honestly.

The framework's extra model-generated answer at its step limit is disabled. It bypasses normal
presentation review and must not be treated as a completed answer. A repeated-call stop, step limit,
or missing final review returns an explicit application-authored incomplete status instead of
raising the generic unavailable/connection error. This status makes no substantive selection or
completion claim; ordinary model-authored answers still require the existing presentation check.

Each model step adds a portable `agent.step.completed` diagnostic with only the step number,
registered runtime tool names, and exception class, if any. Arguments, raw observations and model
reasoning are never included in these diagnostics. Unregistered names are replaced with a fixed
label. Interrupted results include `agent.run.interrupted` with a bounded reason, followed by the
status message and `agent.run.completed` with `outcome: incomplete`. Normal runs use
`outcome: complete`. Result metadata includes `termination_reason`. The conversation service saves
these returned events, including already-validated workspace changes and ordinary redacted tool
activity. A completed checkpoint is therefore reconstructed on a later turn; raw ephemeral source
text is not promoted to durable history.

These event types and optional JSON payload/metadata fields use the existing extensible v1 Event
and AgentResult contracts; no schema revision or database migration is required. Existing consumers
may ignore diagnostics. This is not automatic background continuation or an unlimited task runner.
The model must actually write a workspace checkpoint to retain detailed review progress, and may
need to re-read details it did not capture. Unexpected provider or internal exceptions retain their
existing error path; the incomplete-result handling is limited to the bounded runtime conditions.
