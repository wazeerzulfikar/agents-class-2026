# Canonical events

`Event` is the durable history envelope. A raw chat-message array is not the canonical system history.

The envelope records a stable ID, schema version, timezone-aware timestamp, extensible event type and actor strings, optional principal/conversation/node associations, and JSON-only payload and metadata objects. At most one of `principal_user_id` and `anonymous_session_id` may be set.

Initial event names are defined by the constitution, including `user.message`, `agent.message`, agent-run and tool lifecycle events, resource reads, capability and permission changes, node connection changes, workspace panel changes, memory changes, TA email events, and `system.error`.

Event names remain strings so later phases can add names without changing the event envelope. New names should use a namespaced dotted form and must document their payload before production use.

Application logs and canonical events are separate. Ordinary logs must not become an accidental copy of prompts, private files, grades, or sensitive tool results.

## Phase 3 event payloads

- `user.message`: `text` and portable `input_id`;
- `agent.run.started` / `agent.run.completed`: portable `input_id`, with runtime metadata;
- `agent.tool.requested`: canonical `tool_id` and validated JSON arguments;
- `resource.read`: resource `uri`, never an arbitrary local path;
- `agent.tool.completed`: canonical `tool_id`, `storage_policy`, referenced resources, and only the result permitted by that storage policy;
- `agent.tool.failed`: canonical `tool_id`, a structured error category, and a user-safe
  `reason_code`. The reason code is a bounded identifier such as
  `component_not_registered`; raw exception text is not persisted or streamed;
- `agent.message`: response `text` and portable `input_id`.

`agent.greeting.requested` records an authenticated browser page-load trigger in a fresh owned
conversation. It carries only the platform reason; current notifications remain derived context and
are not copied into the event. The resulting `agent.message` references the trigger in metadata.
There is deliberately no fabricated `user.message` for this operation.

Phase 3's sample syllabus uses `server_full`. The tool adapter already honors `server_summary`, `local_only`, and `ephemeral` by omitting disallowed full results from durable event payloads.

## Phase 7 workspace payloads

- `workspace.panel.opened`: an `open` command containing the complete validated panel;
- `workspace.panel.updated`: a validated `update` or `focus` command;
- `workspace.panel.closed`: a validated `close` command.
- `workspace.interaction`: the existing panel ID/component ID, a permitted semantic
  interaction name, and its validated JSON value.

Each payload has exactly one `command` object conforming to
`shared/schemas/v1/workspace.schema.json`. Panel state is reconstructed by reducing
these events in order. The durable representation contains component IDs, resource
URIs, validated JSON props/state, and layout hints—never React elements, JavaScript,
or PDF.js objects.

## Private email payloads

- `email.ta_question.confirmation_requested`: private question ID/code, subject, exact question,
  optional explicitly selected context, and `pending_confirmation` status;
- `email.ta_question.queued` / `email.ta_question.cancelled`: question ID/code, exact question,
  optional context, and new status from the student's explicit UI action;
- `email.ta_question.created`: question ID/code, subject, and `open` status after the provider accepts
  the staff message;
- `email.ta_answer.received`: question ID/code, subject, sanitized answer, answer source
  (`email` or `online`), and `visibility: private`.

These events belong to the student's owned conversation and user principal. They never contain
mailbox credentials, the student's address, Graph payloads, or arbitrary quoted email history.
An agent continuation produced from one of these trusted actions marks its run lifecycle and
`agent.message` metadata with `trigger_event_id`; this makes retries idempotent without inventing a
user-authored chat message.
Staff email decisions and pending FAQ publications are durable workflow rows rather than private
conversation events. Publication creates a global `faq_entries` record and a
`course_notifications` record; it does not copy the originating student's identity into the public
FAQ.

## Private newsletter payloads

- `instructor.newsletter.confirmation_requested`: issue ID, confirmation ID, fixed audience
  (`all_students` or `test`), recipient count, the test recipients when applicable, subject,
  headline, week, a bounded plain-text preview, and `awaiting_confirmation` status;
- `instructor.newsletter.approved` / `instructor.newsletter.cancelled`: issue ID, confirmation ID,
  subject, recipient count, and the new status from the instructor's explicit UI action. Approval
  queues delivery for the mail worker; it is not a delivery receipt.

These events belong only to the instructor's owned conversation. The authoritative state is the
issue record under `var/newsletter/`, which carries the recipient snapshot and per-recipient
delivery results.

## Private instructor-message payloads

- `instructor.message.confirmation_requested`: private message ID, fixed audience and resolved
  recipient preview, recipient count, exact subject and message, and `pending_confirmation` status;
- `instructor.message.sent` / `instructor.message.cancelled`: message ID, optional source-question
  ID for an online resolution, subject, recipient count, and the new status from the instructor's
  explicit UI action.

These events belong only to the instructor's owned conversation. Generic tool-request events redact
the message arguments. The authoritative cross-user delivery is the PostgreSQL message plus fixed
recipient rows, not a copy placed into student conversation history. Each recipient instead receives
an authorized notification-center and agent-attention projection until they mark the message read.
When a message confirms a pending-question reply, the linked `TAAnswer` is authoritative and the
message row is not separately projected to the student.
An agent continuation from Send or Cancel carries the trusted trigger event ID and creates no fake
`user.message`.

Instructor message confirmation payloads may additionally include `email_available` (boolean)
and optional recipient `email` fields for ordinary messages. These previews are private to the
instructor's owned conversation; anonymous-question previews omit the address. Older previews
without recipient email fields still render correctly.
The sent/cancelled private action payload includes `email_queued` (boolean, false on cancellation).
This records the confirmed delivery choice, not provider delivery success. Older events omit these
fields and preserve in-app-only behavior; the versioned Event envelope is unchanged.
