# Registered workspace protocol

Phase 7 adds a trusted first-party workspace beside the conversation. The agent can
select and control registered components, but it cannot generate JavaScript, React,
HTML, or host UI.

## Stable contracts

The language-neutral authority is `shared/schemas/v1/workspace.schema.json`. Treat
these definitions as stable:

- `ComponentManifest`
- `WorkspaceState`
- `WorkspacePanel`
- `WorkspaceCommand`
- `DocumentHighlightAnchor`

`packages/workspace` contains readable TypeScript bindings and the browser reducer.
`course_server.workspace` contains matching Pydantic bindings and server validator.
`shared/registry/components.json` is the trusted built-in manifest catalog. Contract
tests compare these representations and reject unknown fields.

## Command lifecycle

```text
authorized workspace tool
        ↓
server command validation
        ↓
canonical workspace.panel.* event
        ↓ SSE / conversation history
browser command validation
        ↓
trusted native component map
```

`workspace.list_components`, `workspace.open_component`,
`workspace.update_component`, `workspace.focus_component`, and
`workspace.close_component` use MCP-compatible names, descriptions, JSON input
schemas, and JSON results. They are application wrappers around the canonical MCP
concepts, not a competing tool protocol. The standalone MCP transport/gateway remains
separate from this stable contract.

`workspace.review_presentation` is the turn-ending presentation checkpoint. Immediately before
`final_answer`, the agent must select one bounded decision: keep an appropriate panel inherited
from a prior turn, confirm a panel opened or changed during this turn, or use chat alone when no
panel is open. Platform code verifies the choice against trusted run state. A mismatched choice
fails with `presentation_review_invalid`, and any later tool call invalidates a successful review.
The review request is inspectable through ordinary tool events, while no private rationale or
free-form chain of thought is persisted. This tool adds runtime policy only; it does not change the
versioned workspace schema.

Opening a panel validates the component ID against the trusted registry before checking an
optional resource URI. An invented component therefore fails with the safe
`component_not_registered` reason instead of being misreported as a permission failure. A valid
component still requires its resource URI to be authorized before any content is opened or read.
Tool failures persist and stream a bounded `reason_code` so the browser can present a useful
message without exposing raw exceptions or backing paths.

When workspace tools are authorized, runtime policy treats registered components as
the preferred presentation surface. The agent should display schedules, documents,
and other suitable structured results in a component rather than paste their complete
contents into chat. When a workspace component carries the detailed result, chat gives
only a short handoff or the single next question needed from the user; it does not restate
content already visible in the component. The final checkpoint lets the agent keep, replace,
update, construct, close, or decline a workspace visual according to the current intent; it does
not force a visual when prose is clearer. This preference never bypasses component, prop,
operation, or resource authorization validation, and it does not permit generated JavaScript
or arbitrary UI.

On desktop, the right column is the workspace canvas itself rather than a framed panel
inside the column. The current panel receives the full available height and omits tab
chrome; its close action floats unobtrusively over the canvas. Opening or focusing a
different subject, artifact, or view replaces the previous panel. Component content
remains independently scrollable, so profile descriptions and other material below the
initial viewport are not clipped. At widths of 900 pixels or less, an explicit **Chat / Workspace**
switch selects Workspace when a panel opens and gives the current panel the full available content
height above the shared composer. Chat remains one switch away rather than competing with the panel
in a cramped stacked layout.
The workspace has priority over the notification center in their shared presentation slot. An open
workspace hides, but does not consume, the current notification projection; closing the workspace
restores it immediately.

The server reconstructs workspace state from all prior panel events before a run.
Commands reject unknown components, invalid props, unsupported operations, duplicate
panels, missing panels, and unauthorized resource URIs. The browser validates again
before changing UI state. User focus/close actions return to the server for the same
validation and durable event append.
Calendar selection/view changes and document page/find actions emit validated
`workspace.interaction` events, which are available to the next agent turn without
storing DOM details. A PDF page change also updates the document panel's canonical `page` prop in
the same append, so the focused page survives reloads and is supplied to the next run as trusted
workspace state rather than inferred from recent prose.

Visual Composition `1.1.0` adds a backward-compatible registered-image form. An image
may still carry a verified HTTPS `url`, or it may carry an `asset_id` returned by the
course resource named in the panel's `resource_uri`. The server verifies that the ID
belongs to that resource, and the browser resolves it through the authenticated course
asset endpoint. Existing `1.0.0` URL-based panel events remain valid, so this minor
component version does not require a workspace schema version or persisted-data
migration.

Visual Composition `1.2.0` adds a second backward-compatible trusted image reference:
`applicant://{application_id}/photo`. Only the authorized application image-inspection tool
may authorize
these references for a workspace open in the current turn. The browser resolves them to the
authenticated photo endpoint; students can fetch only explicitly shared application UUIDs,
and public sessions cannot fetch the bytes.
Existing HTTPS and registered-asset panels remain valid, so this minor component version also
requires no workspace schema version or persisted-data migration.

## Resource separation

A panel stores a `resource_uri`; it does not permanently embed syllabus or schedule
data in props. The browser resolves public content through the authorized resource
content endpoint and supplies it to the trusted renderer:

```text
course://schedule → Calendar
course://instructors + registered portrait asset → VisualComposition
applicant://{application_id}/photo → VisualComposition (instructor or authorized student)
specific paper or file → DocumentViewer
knowledge from one or more sources → VisualComposition
specific website → WebpageViewer or BrowserViewer
```

The endpoint accepts only a registered URI already visible to the principal. It never
accepts or returns a backing server path.

Tool results expose their authorized resource URI to the runtime as trusted follow-up
metadata so the model can pass it to a component without presenting it to the user.
For resilience, the calendar tool and browser host both resolve an omitted calendar
resource to `course://schedule` only when that resource is authorized. The browser
fallback also repairs incomplete calendar events already stored in development
conversations; it does not weaken the resource-content endpoint's authorization.

## Built-in components

`document-viewer` opens a specific Markdown, plain-text, or PDF artifact when the user
wants to navigate, search, or discuss its particular content. Markdown uses a maintained
CommonMark/GFM pipeline, including GFM tables, and skips raw HTML. Authorized resource bytes
remain canonical: the viewer creates a rendered projection without rewriting the source. PDF pages are contain-fitted to
the viewer's current usable width and height and rerender when that surface resizes.
The PDF toolbar includes a **Download PDF** icon immediately left of Find, matching the
workspace close icon in size and the Find placeholder in color, retaining both on the About page, which saves the already-authorized original bytes
locally using the document title as the filename. It remains available if page rendering fails
and does not require another server request or a new resource permission. Markdown resources
with a registered PDF edition also show the same icon, linking to their authorized `pdf` asset.
The PDF loading task follows the resource URI and byte buffer, so metadata and conversation
updates do not destroy an in-progress document render. It is not used
merely because a knowledge source is stored as a document.

When a question depends on the visible content of the focused PDF page, the agent may call
`document.inspect_page`. Platform code derives the resource from the focused panel, verifies the
run's resource grant and upload ownership, and defaults to the panel's canonical page. It renders
only that page to a bounded PNG and returns extracted page text plus the multimodal description.
The PNG is transient provider input with provider storage disabled; canonical events retain only a
generic completion summary and resource provenance. The tool accepts no resource URI or server path
from the model. An optional page number can inspect another page only within the same focused PDF.

`visual-composition` is the default presentation component for synthesized knowledge
without a specialized view. The agent reads the source, selects the useful information,
and builds the overview from registered semantic elements.

`calendar` accepts `view` (`month` or `agenda`), `focus_date`, and
`selected_event_id`. It consumes normalized event data. The Phase 6 weekly schedule is
maintained as Markdown and parsed at the trusted renderer boundary; missing dates remain
explicitly unconfirmed.

`webpage-viewer` accepts a required HTTPS `url`, plus `mode` and optional readable
`content`. Reader mode is the safe default: the agent first uses `web.visit`, then the
component renders the returned Markdown as text nodes without an iframe or injected
HTML. This works when sites such as Google or the Media Lab prohibit embedding.

Live mode uses a sandboxed iframe only when explicitly requested. It permits scripts,
forms, modals, and popups for ordinary page compatibility, but deliberately omits
`allow-same-origin`, top navigation, downloads, storage, and host privileges. It sends
no referrer and warns that the remote site's CSP or `X-Frame-Options` may still refuse
the frame. A legacy URL-only panel renders a clean external-link fallback instead of
attempting a predictably broken iframe.

The trusted host can focus the entire webpage panel, but it cannot inspect, focus, or
mark arbitrary elements inside a cross-origin iframe. Same-origin browser security
intentionally prevents that access. Element-level page highlighting will use the
browser extension's semantic DOM tools in Phase 14, or an explicit cooperative-page
`postMessage` protocol; the host does not weaken the iframe sandbox to simulate it.

`browser-viewer` is the preferred visual surface when a public site blocks embedding.
It displays an authenticated live viewport stream from an isolated server-side browser session
(with a labeled snapshot fallback),
so Google, the Media Lab, and similarly configured sites do not need to consent to being
framed. Its session ID is issued by platform code and scoped to one principal and
conversation. The agent can navigate, scroll, and highlight visible text through the
isolated `browser.*` tools; the user can scroll and click the rendered page with native
controls, and the resulting URL and title become current workspace state. See
[`BROWSER.md`](BROWSER.md) for lifecycle, capacity, privacy, and network safeguards.

`draft-document` is a general evolving-document surface, not an application-specific
form. It renders safe Markdown prose, up to 50 structured fields, or both, without HTML
injection. It can hold proposals, reports, notes, letters, outlines, plans, forms, and
applications. Fields may be marked `missing`, `candidate`, `inferred`, or `confirmed`.
Fields may also declare a bounded list of options; `draft-document` version 1.1.0 renders
those fields as native selects while retaining textareas for open responses. Version
1.2.0 adds optional semantic input types, help text, and field validation messages.
Application drafts use short text, email, URL, year, multiline, and attachment-receipt
presentations without exposing the internal photo receipt as an editable value. Bounded
invalid text remains durable as a candidate so applicants can correct it without losing
work. These are additive component-props changes; version 1.0.0 drafts remain valid.
Reading an authorized assignment opens the exact stored Markdown in the safe renderer as a
read-only workspace document. No assignment-authoring component is registered.
The runtime receives current trusted workspace state and instructs the agent to update
the existing panel rather than open duplicates. Updates are canonical workspace events
and survive conversation reloads. A rendered draft never counts as submission,
publication, or approval.

`visual-composition` is the trusted composable surface for results that do not belong
in one specialized viewer. It uses a flat object graph: every element has a stable ID,
and `group` elements reference their children by ID. Groups provide semantic stack,
row, and grid layouts plus bounded spacing, alignment, surface, padding, radius, and
width variants. Leaf elements are `image`, `heading`, `text`, `badge`, `link`, `facts`,
`input`, `textarea`, `divider`, and `spacer`.

This can represent instructor/student profiles, directories, image-and-text summaries,
lightweight forms, and other composed visuals without turning model output into code.
The registry rejects unknown properties and variants. Both Python and TypeScript hosts
also require one unique root, unique element IDs, valid references, a single parent per
element, no cycles, and no unreachable objects. The renderer accepts no HTML, CSS,
Tailwind classes, JavaScript, event handlers, or arbitrary style values. Remote images
must use HTTPS and are loaded without a referrer; private applicant images instead use a
tool-issued opaque URI resolved by the trusted host. Editable inputs remain local while typing
and emit a bounded `visual.change` workspace interaction on blur; they do not submit or cause
external effects.

## Phase boundary and deviations

There are no architecture deviations in Phase 7. Workspace tools are currently
executed through the existing application-owned tool adapter, as prior phases require;
their MCP-compatible contracts can be published by the capability gateway without
changing persisted events or UI state. MCP Apps, arbitrary external interfaces, and
workspace database snapshots are intentionally deferred. Canonical events already
provide sufficient persistence for the current class scale.

Application sharing update: authenticated students may use the existing application-review
tools and photo route only for accepted application UUIDs explicitly shared in the private
`student-access.json` registry. Instructor access remains unrestricted. See
[STORAGE.md](STORAGE.md) for authorization, provisioning, and revocation details.


### Page Cards thumbnail gallery (manifest 1.1.2)

The additive `presentation` prop accepts `previews` (legacy/default) or `thumbnails`
(two columns on desktop, one on narrow screens). A thumbnail item requires a public HTTPS
`image_url`, a protected `preview_id` and `revision`, or an explicit
`preview_unavailable: true` fallback. The fallback retains the student name and website link.
The frontend derives authenticated capture URLs; the model cannot supply endpoint URLs.

`browser.compare` validates discovered image references and captures weekly pages when an
image is absent. A failed thumbnail capture preserves the other cards and reports a safe
reason code. Security failures remain fatal. Generic workspace open/update tools cannot
invent thumbnail captures or bypass image validation; they direct the agent to `browser.compare`.
After a showcase selection, presentation review requires its four-student gallery to remain
visible. An empty workspace or a subsequently opened single webpage cannot pass that review.

Python and TypeScript manifests are synchronized. Legacy preview props remain valid;
incomplete thumbnail props without an image, capture or explicit fallback must be regenerated.
There is no core wire-schema change or database migration. Deploy backend and frontend together
so both validators accept the new props. Protected capture ownership and expiry are unchanged.
