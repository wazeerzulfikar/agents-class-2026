# Class Agent

Class Agent is the extensible Course Agent platform described in [CONSTITUTION.md](CONSTITUTION.md). It is designed for an MIT Media Lab course and favors explicit, portable contracts that students can inspect and extend.

The repository is currently at **Phase 7**, plus the explicitly authorized course-email workflow from Phase 10: validated native workspace components over the Phase 6 Course Agent, with an optional Gmail or Microsoft 365 mailbox worker for unanswered student questions and email-moderated FAQ publication. It contains stable core and workspace contracts, access-code and anonymous authentication, portable PostgreSQL conversation/event history, a `ToolCallingAgent` adapter, public course resources and search, private course applications, typed workspace tools, an event-derived panel workspace, visual compositions, a specific-artifact DocumentViewer, a month/agenda Calendar, and a role-scoped notification center for course releases, staff communications, and near assignment deadlines. It intentionally does not yet contain MCP Apps, Agent Bridge, or a browser extension. It loads standard `SKILL.md` bundles progressively: the model initially sees only login-authorized skill metadata and reads full instructions or references on demand.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- Node.js 20 or newer
- pnpm 10
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python environments and commands
- Docker with Compose for the reference development PostgreSQL service

## Setup

On macOS, install the development tools with Homebrew and start the Colima Docker runtime:

```bash
brew install uv node pnpm docker docker-compose colima
colima start
docker version
docker-compose version
```

If Docker reports `docker-credential-desktop` is missing after switching from Docker Desktop, remove the stale `"credsStore": "desktop"` entry from `~/.docker/config.json`, then retry the pull.

From the repository root:

```bash
uv sync
pnpm install
docker-compose up -d postgres
cp -n .env.example .env
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://class_agent:class_agent_dev@127.0.0.1:5432/class_agent
uv run python -m course_server.migrations apply
uv run python -m course_server.index_resources
```

Put your key in `.env` as one unquoted, single-line assignment and leave `.env` uncommitted. Do not add literal `\\n` characters. Blank lines between assignments are fine:

```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
BRAVE_API_KEY=your-brave-search-key-here
MODEL_ID=gpt-5.6-terra
```

Anonymous visitors are limited for the lifetime of their seven-day session. The production
defaults are three conversations, ten agent runs, five uploads, and 20 MiB of uploads. Tune
`ANONYMOUS_MAX_CONVERSATIONS`, `ANONYMOUS_MAX_AGENT_RUNS`, `ANONYMOUS_MAX_UPLOADS`, and
`ANONYMOUS_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` in `.env`; authenticated users are exempt. Local development can
set `ANONYMOUS_QUOTAS_ENABLED=false`, but deployed environments should keep it enabled.
Production should also
enforce the per-IP limits in `deploy/cognitive-agents.nginx` because browser cookies can be reset.

The CLI intentionally does not override variables already exported in the shell. If you previously exported an old key, run `unset OPENAI_API_KEY MODEL_API_KEY BRAVE_API_KEY` so `.env` is used. Then run one CLI turn:

```bash
uv run python -m course_server.agent_cli "What does the syllabus say?"
```

Run the API at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` with:

```bash
uv run python -m course_server.api
```

The runtime prompt, authorized tool catalog, and public resource index are constructed
at API startup. Restart this process after changing Python runtime behavior or resource
manifests. Public resource file contents themselves are read when a tool is called.
For a PDF open in the workspace, the current page is canonical conversation state and the agent can
inspect that single page visually when asked about "this slide." The server derives the document
from the focused authorized panel, renders a bounded image, and keeps the image bytes out of durable
history.

In another terminal, run the web app:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Vite serves the interface at `http://localhost:5173` and proxies `/api` to the
development API. Click the centered `Course Agent` title to open login and
conversation navigation. The default production build uses same-origin
`/api/v1`; set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` only when deploying the API elsewhere.

The API's session cookies are always marked `Secure`, including in development. A browser must therefore access it through HTTPS to retain sessions; terminating local TLS at a development proxy is the closest production-equivalent setup. The API is documented at `/docs`, with canonical routes under `/api/v1`. Public resource metadata is available at `/api/v1/course/resources`; the schedule is marked `provisional` until its details are confirmed.

Chat attachments are stored for 24 hours under `UPLOAD_DATA_PATH` (default
`var/uploads/`). Complete course applications submitted through the agent are written
as private structured records with a durable photo under `APPLICANT_DATA_PATH` (default
`var/applicants/`). Both directories are ignored by Git; only the applicant directory
normally belongs in protected production backups. See
[docs/COURSE_RESOURCES.md](docs/COURSE_RESOURCES.md) for resource manifests, automatic
indexing, uploads, and application-storage operations.

Course assignments are one validated JSON file each in a dedicated directory under
`ASSIGNMENT_DATA_PATH` (default `var/assignments/`). Released assignments are available to logged-in students and TAs through the
agent and drive the notification center's release and fourteen-day deadline items; reading one opens
the exact posted Markdown in the workspace. The application does not expose an assignment-authoring
tool or editor. See
[docs/ASSIGNMENTS.md](docs/ASSIGNMENTS.md) for the exact schema and operations.

Logged-in instructors can look up active student names, usernames, and emails through the
instructor-only student directory tool. They can also prepare an in-app message for all active students or a validated
set of specific students through the instructor-only messaging skill. The platform snapshots the
resolved recipients, shows the exact subject, message, and audience, and requires a separate Send
or Cancel action before delivery. In the same preview, **Also send by email** optionally queues
a separate email copy for each student through the configured mail worker. This defaults to off;
in-app delivery always occurs. Confirmed messages remain in each recipient's Communications
stack and authorized agent context until the student marks them read.

Students can use the application-review tools for accepted applicants explicitly shared by
UUID in the private `APPLICANT_DATA_PATH/student-access.json` registry. On server startup, a private
`APPLICANT_DATA_PATH/accepted-applicants.json` roster is resolved against existing applications
and frozen to UUIDs. Install this file directly on the server; it is ignored by Git.
Without a local roster or an existing UUID allowlist, student application access stays closed.
Missing or ambiguous matches stay blocked; existing access registries are preserved. See [docs/STORAGE.md](docs/STORAGE.md) for provisioning.

Role-scoped course resources live under `COURSE_DATA_PATH` (default `data/`): student
resources are available to logged-in students and instructors, while instructor resources
are available only to instructors. Their contents are ignored by Git and are never added to
the public registry or PostgreSQL public search index.

Authenticated students can optionally escalate a question that the maintained site and
appropriate research cannot answer. The agent prepares the exact email, but platform code
requires the student to choose **Send** before the separate worker contacts course staff.
Staff replies are matched to the question, stored privately, emailed to the account address,
added to that student's conversation, and replace the pending thread in the student's notification
center. The staff reply must place `PUBLISH` or `PRIVATE` on a
standalone line immediately before or after the answer (`PUBLIC` is accepted as an alias for
`PUBLISH`). The command and adjacent blank lines are removed from the student-facing answer.
`PUBLISH` also adds the redacted question
and answer to searchable `course://faq` knowledge and generates an unread login notification for
students, while `PRIVATE` keeps it student-specific. Configure each cloned deployment with its
own dedicated Gmail or Outlook mailbox, staff list, and provider credentials; see
[docs/EMAIL.md](docs/EMAIL.md).

The agent can list and read the logged-in student's complete private communication history on
demand. This includes questions whose student identity was hidden from staff and confirmed in-app
messages addressed to that student. Platform code derives the owner from the active session; no
tool argument can select another student. Only a staff reply explicitly marked `PUBLISH` is also
available to other users through the public course Q&A/FAQ.
Recent published Q&A additions can be listed without a topical query, while topic-specific FAQ
questions use the separate public search tool.

For logged-in course members, active updates, communications, and near deadlines appear
automatically as a compact right-edge card stack. A small **See more** control keeps read updates,
resolved communications, and past deadlines available as newest-first history without treating them
as active again. Each authenticated page load also asks the Course Agent for a fresh greeting using those same
authorized items. It gives a compact agent-authored list separating new changes from pending
communications and assignments, or suggests something useful when the projection is empty. A
successful welcome acknowledges the Updates visible for that opening so they are absent next time;
ongoing Communications and Upcoming items remain until their own state changes.

An optional read-only GitHub integration connects the agent directly to the real
`mitmedialab/agents2026-*` course repositories. All authenticated course roles can inspect every
deployed student website; TAs, instructors, and admins also receive repository source and
development metadata tools. The credential remains server-side and the configured organization,
prefix, and exclusions are enforced in platform code. See
[docs/STUDENT_PROJECTS.md](docs/STUDENT_PROJECTS.md).

Instructors can produce the weekly class newsletter, *The Class Runtime*, with the command line
described under [Newsletter](#newsletter) below.

Weekly showcase selection is available to staff through the read-only project integration:
two rubric-ranked builds plus two weighted random draws, with a two-issue cooldown and reduced
weight for older appearances. Enter actual Week 1 presenters in
`var/student-showcase/history.json`; see [the setup and policy](docs/STUDENT_PROJECTS.md#weekly-build-showcase).

Staff-published FAQ knowledge is kept separately from maintained course files in one local,
versioned JSON file at `var/course-knowledge/published-faq.json`. The mail worker updates it
automatically after an authorized `PUBLISH` reply, and the Course Agent reads it through
`course://faq`. It contains public FAQ fields only and is ignored by Git. Override its location with
`PUBLISHED_FAQ_PATH`; see [docs/STORAGE.md](docs/STORAGE.md).

Run the real PostgreSQL integration test with:

```bash
export TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://class_agent:class_agent_dev@127.0.0.1:5432/class_agent
uv run pytest -m postgres
```

## Newsletter

*The Class Runtime* is a weekly email of the best student builds. Instructors can ask the Course
Agent to draft, review, and send it (the `instructor-newsletter` skill and three instructor-only
tools; Send is a platform confirmation card and the mail worker delivers approved issues), or run
the same pipeline from the command line below. Nothing runs on a schedule and nothing is sent
until an instructor approves it. Run everything from `class-agent/` with the same `.env` the server uses (read-only GitHub
token, OpenAI key, Gmail credentials). If your shell exports a stale `OPENAI_API_KEY`, run
`unset OPENAI_API_KEY` first so the `.env` value is used.

```bash
# 1. Draft the week that just finished. Reads every course repository, scores each project
#    against the week's assignment goal, selects the top four in code, captures an image from
#    each student's post, and writes the copy. Takes a few minutes.
uv run python -m course_server.newsletter draft

# 2. Review. The command prints the scoreboard and the text; open the HTML for the real look.
open var/newsletter/issues/2026-week02.html

# 3. Optional: a test copy to yourself. The issue stays a draft.
uv run python -m course_server.newsletter send 2026-week02 --test-to you@mit.edu

# 4. Approve and send. Prints the recipient list and waits for you to type SEND.
uv run python -m course_server.newsletter send 2026-week02 --to-active-students
```

The week is chosen automatically as the most recent class week whose build window has closed,
from `shared/course/schedule/schedule.md`; `--week N` or `--as-of YYYY-MM-DD` override it. Running
`draft` again regenerates a draft; a week that was already sent is refused unless `--force` is
passed. `list` shows every issue and its status, and `show <issue> [--html]` reprints one.
Recipients are `--to`, `--to-active-students` (every active student account), and the
`NEWSLETTER_RECIPIENTS` list in `.env`.

The code lives in [`python/course_server/newsletter/`](python/course_server/newsletter/):

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `cli.py`, `__main__.py` | The `draft`, `show`, `list`, and `send` commands and their `.env` wiring |
| `schedule.py` | Parses the course schedule into weeks, build windows, and assignment goals |
| `collect.py` | Reads each repository's week folder, commits, and deployed site through the read-only GitHub catalog |
| `score.py` | Rubric scoring per project, weights, goal-fit floor, cooldown, and the final selection |
| `images.py`, `screenshots.py` | Finds the student's week post, captures its visuals, lets the model choose, re-encodes for email |
| `compose.py` | Prompts and validation for the model-written copy; the OpenAI writer |
| `render.py` | Plain-text and HTML renderings in the course site's visual language |
| `store.py`, `models.py` | Issue records, scores, images, and delivery history under `var/newsletter/` |
| `service.py` | The draft and send workflow that ties the pieces together |
| `quotes.py` | The rotating closing quotes from AI pioneers |

Tests are in `python/tests/test_newsletter.py`; the operational reference, including how
selection and images work and what the model can and cannot decide, is
[docs/NEWSLETTER.md](docs/NEWSLETTER.md).

The default tests use a scripted model and do not spend OpenAI credits.

## Production hardening

The reference deployment files under `deploy/` provide TLS termination, security headers,
per-IP API/model rate and connection limits, a sandboxed systemd API service, and a conservative
SSH baseline. Follow `deploy/HARDENING.md` for firewall and SSH installation. Do not disable SSH
password authentication until a public key has been installed and verified in a separate session.
